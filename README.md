## What is _hypnotoad_?  
_Hypnotoad_ is a small apllication to draw visuals onto a screen.
The visuals can be controlled via a monome controller,
or using the built-in virtual monome interface.
Hypnotad started as a simple project to learn programming.
While continuing to learn I also want to add more functionality to this.

## What is hypnotoad?  
Ora is a small apllication to draw visuals onto a screen.
The visuals can be controlled via a monome controller,
or using the built-in virtual monome interface.
Ora started as a simple project to learn programming.
While continuing to learn I also want to add more functionality to this.

## Documentation  
Ora provides a built-in Help Menu with instructions.

## Requirements  
* [Processing](processing.org)

* [monome-processing library](github.com/monome/monome-processing/releases/latest)

* [oscP5 library](sojamo.de/libraries/oscp5)

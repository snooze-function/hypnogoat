## What is _hypnotoad_?  
_Hypnotoad_ is a small apllication to draw visuals onto a screen.  
The visuals can be controlled via a monome controller,
or using the built-in virtual monome interface.  
Hypnotad started as a simple project to learn programming.  
While continuing to learn I also want to add more functionality to _Hypnotoad_.

## Documentation  
_Hypnotoad_ provides a built-in Help Menu with instructions.

## Requirements  
* [Processing](processing.org)

* [monome-processing library](github.com/monome/monome-processing/releases/latest)

* [oscP5 library](sojamo.de/libraries/oscp5)

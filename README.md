## What is _hypnogoat_?  
_hypnogoat_ is a small apllication to draw visuals onto a screen.  
The visuals can be controlled via a monome controller,
or using the built-in virtual monome interface.  
_hypnogoat_ started as a simple project to learn programming.  
While continuing to learn I also want to add more functionality to _hypnogoat_.

## Documentation  
_hypnogoat_ provides a built-in Help Menu with instructions.
